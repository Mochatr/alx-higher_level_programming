## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile language used for various purposes including scripting and web front-end development. Initially, we'll focus on scripting to understand the basic concepts of JavaScript. Later, we'll dive into making dynamic web projects like an AirBnB clone using JavaScript and jQuery.
