# Python Networking Project

## Overview
This project is an educational endeavor designed to teach the fundamentals of network programming in Python. It emphasizes the use of the Python packages `urllib` and `requests` to perform various network operations, such as fetching internet resources, handling HTTP requests, and working with JSON data.

## Resources

### Read or Watch:
- [HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html)
- [Quickstart with Requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/)
- [Requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to fetch internet resources with the Python package `urllib`.
- How to decode `urllib` body response.
- How to use the Python package `requests`. Remember, #requestsiswaysimplerthanurllib.
- How to make HTTP GET requests.
- How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests.
- How to fetch and manipulate JSON resources.
- How to manipulate data from an external service.

## Requirements
- Use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- All files must be compatible with Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Follow pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- Include a description in all modules and methods.
- Code should not execute when imported.
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key.
- All files must be executable and end with a new line.
