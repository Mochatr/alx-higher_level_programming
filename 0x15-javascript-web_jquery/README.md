## More Info

To use jQuery in your project, include the following script tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

<head> 
	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script> 
</head>

This project is designed to help you gain a solid understanding of JavaScript and jQuery, enabling you to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Happy coding!
